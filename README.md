# Multi-Channel Sarcasm Detection

This repository provides the official implementation of the paper:

**"A Multi-Channel Sarcasm Detection Model Integrating Syntax and Semantics"**





## 📊 Results
Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in terms of **accuracy** and **F1-score**, outperforming several strong baselines including DCNet, ADGCN, and SarcPrompt-Clash-RoBERTa.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `dataname/` : Preprocessed datasets used in experiments.

- `dataUtils/` : Helper functions (data loader, preprocessing, etc.).

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- Transformers
- NLTK / SpaCy (for POS tagging)
- SenticNet (for sentiment word detection)
